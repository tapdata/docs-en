# Create Data API


To help developers easily dock interfaces and conveniently view API information published through TapData, we offer a data services feature.

## Supported Data Sources

Currently, it supports Doris, MongoDB, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and TiDB.

## Procedure

1. Log in to TapData Platform.

2. In the left navigation bar, choose **Data Services** > **API List**.

3. Click **Create API** at the top right of the page, then complete the settings on the right panel according to the instructions below.

   * **Key Configuration Fields**
     * **Service Name**: Give your API a meaningful name for easier identification and management.
     * **Owner Application**: Select the business application this API belongs to. This helps categorize your APIs clearly. See [Application Management](manage-app.md) for more details.
   - **Interface Type**: TapData provides two modes for querying data via APIs:
     - **Default Query**: A general-purpose mode with built-in pagination and filtering, suitable for client-driven access.
     - **Custom Query**: A structured mode that enables domain-specific APIs with full control over query logic, sorting, and inputs.
   - **API Path Settings**: Your API path follows the format `/api/{version}/{prefix}/{base_path}`.
     - `version` and `prefix` are optional and can be used for versioning or business labeling (e.g., `/api/v1/orders/summary`).
     - `base_path` is required and uniquely identifies the endpoint. It is auto-generated if left blank.
   - **Input Parameters**: Define the parameters clients can pass when calling this API.
     - For **Default Query**, the platform automatically includes three built-in parameters: `page`, `limit`, and `filter`. This allows dynamic pagination and filtering by the client; custom parameters are **not** supported.
     - For **Custom Query**, you can define your own parameters (such as `region`, `startDate`, or `userLevel`), and map them to specific filter or sort conditions in the UI. In this mode, all filtering is managed server-side; the `filter` parameter is not included unless you explicitly add it. For supported types and configuration rules, see [API Query Parameters](query/api-query-params.md).
   - **Output Results**: By default, the response will include all fields of the selected object. You can also manually adjust the response to return only specific fields, assign aliases to fields, or apply data masking rules.
   
4. Click **Save** at the top right of the page.

5. Find the service you just created and click **Publish** on its right to use the related service.

6. (Optional) Click the service you just created, select the **Debug** tab in the right panel, enter request parameters, and click **Submit** to verify service availability.

7. (Optional) For the data services you have created, you can <span id="release330-export-api">select and export them</span> for backup or sharing with other team members. You can also import data services.

   Additionally, for published data services, you can select them and click **API Document Export** to quickly establish API usage documentation within the team. The exported Word file is in docx format and includes data service name, API description, GET/POST parameter descriptions.
