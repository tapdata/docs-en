Excel is a wide range of data statistics and data analysis software. TapData supports reading Excel files stored on local, FTP, SFTP, SMB, or S3FS to meet a variety of data flow needs.

This article describes how to connect to Excel data source on TapData Cloud.

## Supported File Formats

Supports both XLS and XLSX formats and forms that include merged cells and formulas.

## Precautions

- A connection only refers to a model (table). If there are multiple models, you need to create connections for each one separately.
- Excel data sources are only available for data transformation tasks.
- To avoid excessive memory usage on machines, it is recommended that Excel files do not exceed 512 MB.
- By default, TapData checks for changes (such as adding or modifying) to the XML file every minute. TapData synchronizes all files to accurately update the condition field when changes are detected. However, synchronous deletion of files or data is not supported.
- Data types that can be used in Excel files include BOOLEAN, DATE, DOUBLE, STRING, and TEXT.

## Preparations

Before establishing the connection, it is essential to follow the necessary preparations outlined in the article. These preparations may include authorizing an account and performing other relevant steps to ensure a smooth and secure connection.
This article describes the steps to prepare for creating an Excel data source connection.

Select the option to read based on the location of the Excel file.
