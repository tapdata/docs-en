## Preparation
1. Log in to the MySQL database and execute the following commands to create an account.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs className="unique-tabs">
<TabItem value="MySQL 5.x" default>
```

```sql
CREATE USER 'username'@'host' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="MySQL 8.x and above">

```sql
CREATE USER 'username'@'host' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

* **username**: Enter user name.
* **password**: Enter password.
* **host**: Enter the host that can be accessed by the account, percent (%) means to allow all host.

Example: Create an account named `Atlas-View`:

```sql
CREATE USER 'Atlas-View'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpasswd';
```

2. Grant permissions to the account that we just created, we recommend setting more granular permissions control based on business needs.
```mdx-code-block
<Tabs className="unique-tabs">
<TabItem value="Full Data Synchronization" default>
```

```sql
-- Grant read permissions for the specified database
GRANT SELECT ON database_name.* TO 'username' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Full + Incremental Data Synchronization">

```sql
-- Grant read permissions for the specified database
GRANT SELECT ON database_name.* TO 'username' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
-- Grant replication permissions
GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'username' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

* **database_name**: The name of the database to grant permissions.
* **username**: Enter user name.
* **password**: Enter password.

3. To ensure that the incremental data of the MySQL database can be read, you need to follow the steps below to turn on Binlog.

   1. Use the `vim` command to modify the configuration in `$MYSQL_HOME/mysql.cnf`, for example:

      ```bash
      server_id         = 223344
      log_bin           = mysql-bin
      expire_logs_days  = 1
      binlog_format     = row
      binlog_row_image  = full
      ```

      - **server_id**: Set to an integer greater than 0, this value must be unique per server and replication client.
      - **log_bin**: The base name of the Binlog sequence file.
      - **expire_logs_days**: The number of days to retain binary log files, automatically deleting them upon expiration.
      - **binlog_format**: Set to `row`.
      - **binlog_row_image**: Set to `full`.

   2. After modification, restart the MySQL service with the following command:

      ```bash
      /etc/init.d/mysqld restart
      ```

   3. (Optional) Log in to the MySQL database and execute the following command to confirm that the configuration has taken effect, that is, in the output result, the value of the **binlog_format** is **ROW**.

      ```sql
      SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'binlog_format';
      ```

      The output is as follows:

      ```sql
      +---------------+-------+
      | Variable_name | Value |
      +---------------+-------+
      | binlog_format | ROW   |
      +---------------+-------+
      1 row in set (0.00 sec)
      ```

### <span id="ssl">Enable SSL Connection (Optional)</span>

To further enhance the security of the data connection, you can choose to enable SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption for MySQL databases. This provides encryption at the transport layer for network connections, enhancing the security of communication data while ensuring data integrity. The specific steps are as follows:

1. Log in to the device where MySQL is hosted and run the **mysql_ssl_rsa_setup** program to create SSL/RSA files. You can use the `find` command to locate the program.

   Before performing this step, you can log in to the MySQL database and run the `SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE '%ssl%';` command to check if SSL/RSA files have been generated and if SSL is enabled.

   ```bash
   /usr/bin/mysql_ssl_rsa_setup
   ```

   :::tip

   * Ensure that the device has **openssl** installed to run this program. For example, on CentOS, you can run `yum install openssl -y` to install it.
   * After executing the command, the files `ca-key.pem`, `server-key.pem`, and `client-key.pem` will be automatically generated, typically located in the `/var/lib/mysql/` directory. You can download these files for use when configuring the connection in Atlas-View.

   :::

2. Use the `vim` command to modify the configuration in `$MYSQL_HOME/mysql.cnf`, enabling forced SSL authentication and specifying the locations of the relevant SSL/RSA files. After modification, save and exit the editor.

   ```bash
   [mysqld]
   require_secure_transport=ON
   # Self-signed CA certificate
   ssl-ca=/var/lib/mysql/ca.pem
   # Server certificate file
   ssl-cert=/var/lib/mysql/server-cert.pem
   # Server private key file
   ssl-key=/var/lib/mysql/server-key.pem
   [client]
   # Enable SSL enforced authentication
   ssl-mode=REQUIRED
   # Certificate file required by the client to connect to the server
   ssl-cert=/var/lib/mysql/client-cert.pem
   # Private key file required by the client to connect to the server
   ssl-key=/var/lib/mysql/client-key.pem
   ```

3. Log in to the MySQL database and **optionally** run the following commands to adjust the account for data synchronization/development tasks.

   ```sql
   ALTER USER 'username'@'host' REQUIRE x509; -- Enforce client to provide valid certificate
   ALTER USER 'username'@'host' REQUIRE ssl; -- Do not enforce client to provide valid certificate
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

   * **username**: The username.
   * **host**: The host allowed to log in with this account, with the percentage symbol (`%`) representing any host.

4. Restart the MySQL database.

## Add MySQL Data Source
1. [Log in to Atlas-View Platform](../user-guide/log-in.md).

2. In the left navigation panel, click **Connections**.

3. On the right side of the page, click **Create**.

4. In the pop-up dialog, search for and select **MySQL**.

5. On the redirected page, fill in the MySQL connection information as described below.

   ![Connection Configuration Example](../images/connect_mysql.jpg)

    * **Connection Settings**
        * **Name**: Enter a unique name with business significance.
        * **Type**: Support using MySQL as either a source database.
        * **Deployment Mode**: Support for single-node and primary-replica architecture. When selecting the primary-replica architecture, provide the primary and replica server addresses and service ports. The primary server information should be entered in the first row.
        * **Server Address**: Database connection address.
        * **Port**: Database service port.
        * **Database**: The database name. Each connection corresponds to one database. If there are multiple databases, create multiple connections.
        * **Username**: The database username.
        * **Password**: The database password.
    * **Advanced Settings**
        * **Connection Parameter String**: Default is `useUnicode=yes&characterEncoding=UTF-8`, indicating that data transmission will use the UTF-8 encoded Unicode character set, which helps avoid character encoding issues.
        * **Timezone**: Default is set to 0 timezone. If configured to another timezone, it will affect fields without timezone information (e.g., `datetime`). Fields with timezone information (e.g., `timestamp`, `date`, and `time`) are not affected.
        * **CDC Log Caching**: [Mining the source database's](../user-guide/advanced-settings/share-mining.md) incremental logs. This allows multiple tasks to share the same source databaseâ€™s incremental log mining process, reducing duplicate reads and minimizing the impact of incremental synchronization on the source database. After enabling this feature, you will need to select an external storage to store the incremental log information.
        * **Contain Table**: The default option is **All**, which includes all tables. Alternatively, you can select **Custom** and manually specify the desired tables by separating their names with commas (,).
        * **Exclude Tables**: Once the switch is enabled, you have the option to specify tables to be excluded. You can do this by listing the table names separated by commas (,) in case there are multiple tables to be excluded.
        * **Agent Settings**: Defaults to **Platform automatic allocation**, you can also manually specify an agent.
        * **Model Load Time**: If there are less than 10,000 models in the data source, their schema will be updated every hour. But if the number of models exceeds 10,000, the refresh will take place daily at the time you have specified.
        * **Enable Heartbeat Table**: Atlas-View will create a `_atlas-view_heartbeat_table` heartbeat table in the source database and update it every 10 seconds (requires appropriate permissions) to monitor the health of the data source connection and tasks. The heartbeat task starts automatically after the data replication/development task starts, and you can view the heartbeat task in the data source editing page.
    * **SSL Settings**: Choose whether to enable SSL for the data source connection to enhance data security. After enabling this feature, you need to upload CA files, client certificates, client key files, etc., which were obtained in the [Enable SSL Connection](#ssl) section.

6. Click **Test**, and after passing the test, click **Save**.

   :::tip

   If the connection test fails, please follow the prompts to resolve the issue.

## FAQ

- **Q**: Can I synchronze data from MySQL replicas?

  A: Yes, in addition to implementing the above settings for MySQL replicas, you also need to:

  1. Execute the following command to check the parameter configuration of the MySQL replicas and ensure that the value of **log_slave_updates** is 1.

     ```sql
     Select @@log_slave_updates
     ```

  2. Execute the command `SHOW SLAVE STATUS` or `SHOW REPLICA STATUS` to check the delay information of the replica.

     Perform data synchronization after repairing according to specific error reporting.

- **Q**: "Unknown error 1044" appears in the dialog after the connection test.

  **A**: If the correct permissions have been granted, can be checked and fixed by:

  ```sql
  SELECT host, user, Grant_priv, Super_priv FROM mysql.user WHERE user='username';
  -- Check if the Grant_priv field value is 'Y'
  -- If not, execute the following command:
  UPDATE mysql.user SET Grant_priv='Y' WHERE user='username';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  ```
