To ensure uninterrupted business operations, please ensure your payment method remains valid. If you manually cancel your subscription or your payment method becomes invalid and billing fails, the following impacts will occur:

1.	Your created data sources and tasks will be retained and not deleted.
2.	Any running tasks will immediately stop, and scheduled tasks will not be executed.
3.	You will be unable to create or start new data sources and tasks.
4.	Existing data sources will not support connection testing or table model loading.
5.	Data in the Store will not be available for preview or statistical viewing.

Once you resume your subscription, all services will return to normal. If your tasks have been inactive for an extended period, you may need to restart them to ensure data accuracy.
