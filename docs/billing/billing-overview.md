This article introduces billing information such as billing items, billing methods and price descriptions in TapView

TapView charges based on the subscribed compute engine specifications and the amount of data processed. The compute engine specifications determine the data processing speed, while the data volume is measured in GB.

When subscribing to any engine specification, a certain amount of data quota is included. No additional charges will apply if your usage stays within this quota. However, if the usage exceeds the quota, charges will be applied based on the actual data consumption.

Billing information is calculated hourly and charged on a monthly basis. If the accumulated charges are substantial, an earlier payment may be required. Please ensure your payment method remains valid.

After payment is completed, a payment receipt will be sent to the email address you provided. TapView uses Stripe for payment management, and the receipt will be issued by Stripe.
